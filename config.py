    'about_long': '''
    Founded in 2010, BMW Hub began with a simple mission: to provide Houston BMW owners with dealership-quality service at more affordable prices. 
    
    Our founder, a former BMW dealership master technician with over 15 years of experience, noticed that many BMW owners were looking for more personalized service options without the premium dealership prices.
    
    What started as a small two-bay garage has grown into Houston's most trusted independent BMW service center, serving thousands of satisfied customers and maintaining a sterling reputation for quality and honesty.
    
    Despite our growth, we've remained true to our founding principles of technical excellence, personalized service, and fair pricing.
